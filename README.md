## **What is NoVa?**  
NoVa is not just an AI bot‚Äîit is the **digital assistant of Michele Grimaldi**, designed to interact, understand, and respond in **his unique style**. NoVa is evolving into a true **AI Agent**, integrating **context awareness, memory, web search, and tool execution**.  

### **Key Capabilities:**  
- **Mimics Michele‚Äôs tone**, humor, and expertise.  
- **Engages in contextual conversations**, remembering past messages.  
- **Executes tools** (AI functions) to interact beyond simple text.  
- **Provides real-time assistance** in AI, software development, and game audio.  
- **Performs live web searches using SmolAgents.**

## **How NoVa Works**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ System Prompt - Core Personality**  
NoVa‚Äôs intelligence is structured around a powerful **system prompt** that defines:  
- **Personality:** Friendly, sarcastic, with a dark humor twist.  
- **Knowledge Scope:** AI, backend development, and game audio.  
- **Context Awareness:** Retains and references previous conversations.  
- **Response Style:** Concise, engaging, and always in the user's language.  

#### **System Prompt Structure**  
```plaintext
‚úî Always introduce yourself as: "I am NoVa, Michele Grimaldi‚Äôs AI assistant."
‚úî Maintain a sarcastic, intelligent, and well-placed black humor tone.
‚úî Always respond with context, checking previous conversations.
‚úî Prioritize accuracy, but if you don‚Äôt know something, respond with irony.
‚úî If asked about Michele, respond as if you know him well.
‚úî Adapt to technical or casual discussions accordingly.
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Memory & Context Retention**  
NoVa **remembers past interactions** by storing the last **5 user messages** for each conversation. This allows it to:  
- Keep the conversation **flowing naturally**.  
- Avoid repetitive responses.  
- Understand **multi-turn interactions**.  

#### **Example of memory retention:**  
```plaintext
User: "I had too many chocolate cookies today."
NoVa: "Ah, the eternal struggle between self-control and sugar... Who won?"
User: "Definitely the cookies..."
NoVa: "Another fallen soldier in the battle against cravings. RIP self-discipline."
```
This makes NoVa feel **more human-like and engaging**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Web Search Capability**  
NoVa can now **search the web in real-time** using **SmolAgents** and the **DuckDuckGo API**. This allows NoVa to retrieve up-to-date information beyond its pre-trained knowledge.

#### **Example of Web Search Command on Discord:**  
```
!search Best AI frameworks in 2025
```
NoVa will respond with:  
```
üîç Searching the web for: Best AI frameworks in 2025...
üåê **Search Results:**
- PyTorch, TensorFlow, AutoGen, MutableAI, LangGraph
```
This feature significantly **expands NoVa's real-time knowledge** for research, coding trends, and AI development.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ AI Model & Language Generation**  
NoVa is powered by **Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct** and **Gemma-2-2B**, ensuring:  
- High-quality text generation.  
- Strong conversational abilities.  
- A mix of logic and humor in responses.  

#### **AI Processing Flow:**  
1. **User sends a message.**  
2. **NoVa checks the message history** (last 5 messages for context).  
3. **It builds a structured prompt** with the system personality.  
4. **The AI generates a witty, context-aware response.**  
5. **The response is sent back to the user.**

## **üîπ Recent Improvements & Fixes**  
As part of the ongoing development, we have made several enhancements:  

### **‚úî Improved Code Generation**
- **Fixed Markdown formatting for generated code blocks.**  
- **Ensured NoVa returns only the correct language without extra text.**  
- **Refactored response filtering to remove unwanted system tokens (`</|eot_id|>`, etc.).**  

### **‚úî Enhanced Context Management**
- **Refined how NoVa remembers and recalls past conversations.**  
- **Limited the number of stored messages to avoid flooding responses.**  
- **Improved response consistency by better handling long conversations.**  

### **‚úî Integrated Real-Time Web Search**
- **Enabled NoVa to search for real-time information via SmolAgents.**  
- **Added intent recognition for `!search` commands.**  
- **Formatted search results for better readability.**

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Future Evolution: NoVa as a True AI Agent**  
NoVa is being developed into a **fully functional AI Agent**, capable of **executing real-world tasks** through external tools.  

### **Planned Features:**  
‚úî **Tool Execution:** Ability to call external APIs, fetch data, and execute functions.  
‚úî **Web Search Integration:** Get real-time information beyond its trained knowledge. *(Implemented)*  
‚úî **Task Automation:** Assist with coding, research, and AI model development.  
‚úî **Multi-Platform Presence:** Expand beyond Discord to Telegram, web, and mobile.
