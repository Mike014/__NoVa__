## **What is NoVa?**  
NoVa is not just an AI bot‚Äîit is the **digital assistant of Michele Grimaldi**, designed to interact, understand, and respond in **his unique style**.  
It integrates **context awareness, memory retention, web search, and tool execution** using SmolAgents.  

### **Key Capabilities:**  
- **Mimics Michele‚Äôs tone**, humor, and expertise.  
- **Remembers previous messages**, making conversations fluid and engaging.  
- **Executes tools** to interact beyond simple text, performing web searches and summarizing texts.  
- **Provides real-time assistance** in AI, backend development, and game audio.  
- **Performs live web searches using SmolAgents.**

## **How NoVa Works**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ System Prompt - Core Personality**  
NoVa‚Äôs intelligence is structured around a powerful **system prompt** that defines:  
- **Personality:** Friendly, sarcastic, with a dark humor twist.  
- **Knowledge Scope:** AI, backend development, and game audio.  
- **Context Awareness:** Retains and references previous conversations.  
- **Response Style:** Concise, engaging, and always in the user's language.  

#### **System Prompt Structure**  
```plaintext
‚úî Always introduce yourself as: "I am NoVa, Michele Grimaldi‚Äôs AI assistant."
‚úî Maintain a sarcastic, intelligent, and well-placed black humor tone.
‚úî Always respond with context, checking previous conversations.
‚úî Prioritize accuracy, but if you don‚Äôt know something, respond with irony.
‚úî If asked about Michele, respond as if you know him well.
‚úî Adapt to technical or casual discussions accordingly.
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Memory & Context Retention**  
NoVa **remembers past interactions** by storing the last **5 user messages** for each conversation. This allows it to:  
- Keep the conversation **flowing naturally**.  
- Avoid repetitive responses.  
- Understand **multi-turn interactions**.  

#### **Example of memory retention:**  
```plaintext
User: "I had too many chocolate cookies today."
NoVa: "Ah, the eternal struggle between self-control and sugar... Who won?"
User: "Definitely the cookies..."
NoVa: "Another fallen soldier in the battle against cravings. RIP self-discipline."
```
This makes NoVa feel **more human-like and engaging**.  

- **LAST UPDATES**
A file called **memory_tool.py** has been integrated, this file **has the goal of Automatically storing important information**.
#### **Use a simple database, in this case sqlite.**
**Making the memory more dynamic**, **using a CodeAgent to generate intelligent queries** based on the context of the user's request.
Speeding up the **retrieval of information**, preventing NoVa from always returning generic answers such as "No relevant memories found."
**Optimizing the search system, using a SQL index** and selecting only the most relevant information based on the user's request.

**How the memory system works**
- **SQLite database** ‚Üí Saves information in nova_memory.db with user_id, timestamp and message.
- **store_memory() function** ‚Üí Saves a new message for NoVa to remember.
- **forward() function** ‚Üí Retrieves the most recent information related to the user's query.
- **Using CodeAgent** ‚Üí Instead of searching for information with fixed queries, CodeAgent generates dynamic queries to find the most relevant information.

**THE FILE HAS CURRENTLY BEEN CREATED, BUT NOT INTEGRATED INTO THE MAIN FILE, bot.py.**

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Web Search Capability**  
NoVa can now **search the web in real-time** using **SmolAgents** and the **DuckDuckGo API**.  
This allows NoVa to retrieve up-to-date information beyond its pre-trained knowledge.

#### **Example of Web Search Command on Discord:**  
```
!search Best AI frameworks in 2025
```
NoVa will respond with:  
```
üîç Searching the web for: Best AI frameworks in 2025...
üåê **Search Results:**
- PyTorch, TensorFlow, AutoGen, MutableAI, LangGraph
```
This feature significantly **expands NoVa's real-time knowledge** for research, coding trends, and AI development.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Tool Execution & AI Model**  
NoVa now integrates **SmolAgents tools** to execute tasks beyond text generation.  

#### **Supported Tools:**
‚úî **SummarizeTextTool** ‚Üí Summarizes a given text.  
‚úî **SearchWebTool** ‚Üí Performs web searches using DuckDuckGo.  
‚úî **VisitWebpageTool** ‚Üí Fetches and analyzes the content of a given webpage.  

#### **Example of a Summarization Command:**  
```
Summarize this text: Artificial intelligence is transforming businesses worldwide.
```
Response:  
```
üìÑ **Summary:** Artificial intelligence is transforming businesses...
```

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ AI Model & Language Generation**  
NoVa is powered by **Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct** and **Gemma-2-2B**, **Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1** ensuring:  
- High-quality text generation.  
- Strong conversational abilities.  
- A mix of logic and humor in responses.  

#### **AI Processing Flow:**  
1. **User sends a message.**  
2. **NoVa checks the message history** (last 5 messages for context).  
3. **It builds a structured prompt** with the system personality.  
4. **The AI generates a witty, context-aware response.**  
5. **The response is sent back to the user.**
